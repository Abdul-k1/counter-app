# ALTSCHOOL AFRICA

## Third and Final Semester Project

### Task
```
Create a new vue js application using the cli then setup a counter composable with increment, decrement, reset, setValue functions with a valid UI.

You can use local state or vuex for state management albeit using vuex will attract higher marks. Make sure to house your functionality in a page with route - ‘/counter’ any other route should redirect the user to a 404 page handled by your wildcard route.
```

### Intuition
```
This project was built using Bootstrap and VueJS. Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
